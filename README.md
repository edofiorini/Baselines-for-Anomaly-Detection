# mobile-Anomaly-Detection
Project for Mobile Robotic course at the University of Verona - A.Y. 2021/2022

## Purpose

Nowadays in a robotic system hot topics are process monitoring, anomaly detection and maintanence. In fact, it is extremely difficult to detect in advance anomalous behaviours in order to preserve the high quality standard of the system. 
The main idea for adressing that issue is to build a real-time anomaly detection model, from collected time series data, which is able to identify any fault data that do not conform to historical patterns.
This project is an overview of different baselines for detecting anomalies applied on different datasets.
